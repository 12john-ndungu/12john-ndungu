# Sentiment Analysis Flask Application

This project is a web application for sentiment analysis using Flask. The application predicts the sentiment (positive or negative) of a given text input using a pre-trained Logistic Regression model.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface for text input

- Sentiment prediction (positive or negative)

## Prerequisites

1. **Kaggle API Key**:
    - Create a Kaggle account if you don't have one.
    - Go to the Kaggle website, navigate to `My Account`, and scroll down to the `API` section.
    - Click `Create New API Token` to download the `kaggle.json` file.

2. **ngrok Authtoken**:
    - Create an ngrok account if you don't have one.
    - After logging in, go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) to get your authtoken.

## Running the Application

1. **Open the Colab Notebook**:
    - Go to the [Colab Notebook link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-username/sentiment-analysis-flask/blob/main/your_notebook.ipynb).

2. **Upload the Kaggle JSON file**:
    - In the Colab notebook, find the cell where you are prompted to upload the `kaggle.json` file.
    - Upload the `kaggle.json` file you downloaded from Kaggle.

3. **Set up ngrok Authtoken**:
    - In the Colab notebook, find the cell where you are prompted to enter the ngrok authtoken.
    - Replace `YOUR_AUTHTOKEN` with your actual ngrok authtoken.

4. **Run the Cells**:
    - Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to set up the environment, download dependencies, and start the Flask application.

5. **Access the Application**:
    - Once the Flask application is running, you will see an ngrok URL in the output of one of the cells.
    - Click on the ngrok URL to open the application in your browser.
